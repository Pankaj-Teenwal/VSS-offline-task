    <!-- Q. what is Bubbling:- wne an event happend on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent then all the way up on the other ancestors. 
    
        so if we click on the <p> then we'll see 3 alerts: p->div->form.

            this process is called "bubbling"m becouse events "bubble" form the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.
    
    -->

    <!-- <form onclick="alert('form')">
        FORM
        <div onclick="alert('Div')">
          DIV
          <p onclick="alert('p')">p</p>
        </div>
      </form> -->

    <!-- 
    How  to stop bubbling:- a bubbling event goes from the ratget element straight up. Normally it goes upward till <html>, and then to document object, and some events even reach window, calling all handlers on the path.

    but any handlers may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.

    the method for it is event.stopPropagation() -->

    <!-- <button onclick="event.stopPropagation()" , onclick="mouseHover()">
      click Me
    </button> -->

    <!-- <form onclick="alert('form')">
        FORM
        <div onclick="event.stopPropagation()">
          DIV
          <p onclick="alert('p')">p</p>
        </div>
      </form> -->

    <form>
      FORM
      <div>
        DIV
        <p>P</p>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

    elem.addEventListener("click", (e) => alert(`Bubbling: ${elem.tagName}`));
  }
